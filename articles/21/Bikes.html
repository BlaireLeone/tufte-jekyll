<p><strong>Bicyclists have had a contentious history with vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Given their lack of protection, a bicyclist finding themselves unexpectedly in a vehicle’s path will more than likely result in the <a href="cyclist injured">cyclist being injured</a> if not killed. In <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812765">2017</a>, 783 bicyclists died on US roadways; <label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This report was released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Unfortunately, I couldn’t pin down more recent stats. Also, they refer to cyclists as pedalcyclists here to include unicycles, tricycles, nonmotorized vehicles, and the like. I will only use bicyclists and cyclists in this article, but it’s important to note that these stats may be skewed as they include other kinds of pedal-operated vehicles. </span> 96% (or 753) of those deaths involved a vehicle. Most of the time, this is due to simply not seeing the cyclist - bikes are small and often situated below the driver’s line of sight, and because of their maneuverability, they zip through traffic, perhaps coming up on a driver unawares; a driver may also neglect to check for bicyclists nearby, as happens when opening a door into a bike lane. Either way, drivers are liable to fatally injure a cyclist whether they realize it or not. Take for example, <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/run-over-by-an-eighteen-wheeler/">Katie Mckenna</a>, a New York cyclist turned author and motivational speaker. She was run over by a semi-truck when it failed to notice her while making a right turn at an intersection. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Run-Over-Truck-ebook/dp/B01LY9PYBR">her book</a>, she pulls no punches when identifying bicyclist’s vulnerability on the roadway; the first line queries, “So, how do you get run over by a truck? My first recommendation is to ride a bicycle”. According to her book, she signaled in every way possible that she was there. This is a sensationalist example, but one that exemplifies a common problem bicyclists have with surrounding vehicles – a lack of attention.</p>

<p><strong>My Friend Tom</strong></p>

<p>A roommate of mine, Tom, came home one day with a bandaged hand, bruised face, and a general look of shock and bewilderment. He had just come from the hospital after hitting a car on his bike. A negligent happenstance for some, but a truly unlucky feat for Tom.</p>

<p>Here’s what he told me:</p>

<p>While riding into town, post-COVID shutdowns, the streets were empty. This was around the start of quarantine, early April 2020 - hardly anyone was out. Nonetheless, Tom encountered one vehicle on his way.</p>

<p>After shooting down a short, but steep hill, Tom came up on a mid-sized SUV. He was still coasting from the downhill and hoped to use this momentum for an easier ride on the subsequent flat part coming into town.</p>

<p>Tom was accelerating so fast from the momentum, he started making moves to pass the car ahead of him. As he was coming up on the car’s back right bumper, but still a reasonable distance behind, a pedestrian streaked across the road ahead of the car. As Tom put it, the person appeared out of nowhere, whooped and sprinted through the crosswalk, then disappeared into a nearby park. And though the car was still a good distance from the crosswalk, it executed a full stop, the back wheels swinging into the bike lane.</p>

<p>Tom, still trying to maximize his speed from the downhill, ran arm-first into the back window, while his face swung around and hit the side of the car. His hand, probably in trying to brace himself, punched through the bottom right corner of the back window and his arm went through all the way up to the shoulder.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a clear case of an over-reactive driver, the driver, in fact, was not at fault. Instead, the car, a fresh-off-the-lot 2021 vehicle installed with an automatic emergency braking system (AEB), had made the decision to stop. Even though the car was far enough from the pedestrian for the driver to consciously reduce his speed, and even though the whooper/sprinter was speeding so fast through the crosswalk that the car wouldn’t have hit him regardless (according to Tom), the car had recognized a potential target and literally skidded to a halt.</p>

<p>Both Tom and the driver paid for it, the driver in repairing his new car, and Tom with his medical bills and newly cracked bike frame.</p>

<p><strong>So, what does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>I believe there are several takeaways from this story, perhaps the least of which is the question of when it’s prudent for a cyclist to rely on coasting. Tom had hoped to use the momentum from the downhill to ease his pedaling; I think most experienced cyclists have leant on passive energy for speed and ease of riding (plus, there’s a special kind of satisfaction derived from passing a car on your bike, especially while half-coasting). His determination to go faster, however, brought him in the line of fire. Which brings up another question: Is it right to pass another vehicle in such proximity when they are the only other vehicle on the roadway? Legality aside, is doing so inconsiderate if not rash? In retrospect, Tom acknowledges that his attempt at overtaking may have been reckless. Given the flatness of the road, Tom’s experience as a cyclist, and the lightness of his bike, he had no need to save himself the pedaling effort nor outpace the only other vehicle on the roadway.</p>

<p>But the question I ultimately believe to be most poignant here is that of how autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coalesce with bicyclists in the future. I don’t believe one could truly attribute Tom’s accident to the AEBs, given that they were attempting to save the driver and pedestrian from needless harm. However, the fact that an accident resulted nonetheless suggests a need for further analysis of how autonomous vehicles in general interact with bicyclists, as they may not prioritize bicyclist’s safety as highly as they should.</p>

<p><strong>But first – A Little Background</strong></p>

<p>What technology allows autonomous vehicles to be autonomous? And is it fair to question AVs in general despite Tom’s story only featuring AEBs?</p>

<p>In short, autonomous here means driver-less, or else, having little to no need for human supervision. But within this, AVs can be deconstructed into ascending levels of autonomy. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) categorized AVs in 2013, and then <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-&quot;levels-of-driving-automation&quot;-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles">updated them again</a> in 2018, developing 6 tiers of automation, from Level 0, in which the vehicle only makes suggestions to a human driver and occasionally takes over (as evident in Tom’s braking case), to Level 5, where the vehicle has complete control and passengers have confidence in not supervising. Between Levels 2 to 3, is the threshold between the human’s and vehicle’s control; in other words, Level 3 signals the beginning of vehicle autonomy. Despite some company’s misleading advertising, like Tesla’s “<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/26700/tesla-puts-full-self-driving-back-on-the-menu-but-its-not-what-you-think">full self-driving</a>” tech package, as yet, no company involved with AV technology has reached level 5. The table below details each level.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/Bicycles_AVs/AVs level of Autonomy 3.jpg" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure">Before the update in 2018 only 5 levels existed, 0-4. As technology progressed, Level 4 developed a part (a) and (b). Part (b) was eventually bisected into a separate level - Level 5. Images detailing AV tech, history, and projections refer to fully autonomous as Level 4 or Level 5 depending on when they were created.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Looking back at Tom’s story, we don’t see a Level 5 driverless vehicle. Instead, his experience features a human-driven car equipped with AEBs, a form of brake assist designed to help the driver identify and avoid head on collisions, putting this vehicle at a Level 0/Level 1, according to SAE’s interpretation. <label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">It’s also worth noting, that since SAE created the autonomy levels, they have taken on a life of their own. It’s unclear if SAE sanctioned any of the changes or if they were simplified via the proverbial ‘telephone’ process. Many other sources would not characterize AEBs at Level 1 at the least. </span></p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/Bicycles_AVs/AEB.jpg" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<p>These brakes become operational with a command from a computer that receives information from built-in sensors. When these sensors detect possible impending obstacles, they relay that data to the computer, which decides if they are, indeed, obstacles to be avoided; if so, the computer gives the word to brake. In other words, AEBs are a low-level form of artificial intelligence (AI). Like AEB’s, AI makes decisions according to information it receives. While the AI of today is getting increasingly more complicated, analyzing a broader spectrum of data in more depth and outputting information akin to a human’s intelligence (and in many ways faster), at their core they operate by gathering, synthesizing, and processing data. Principally, this process is the same as an AEB’s decision making, and therefore, an AV’s decision making as well.</p>

<p>Thus, despite Tom’s brush with what could be considered a limited version of AI, these brakes are in fact the immature fledglings of a fully autonomous vehicle. More than that, the AVs of today are intended by some to be the prototype of a nationwide fleet of vehicles.  <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/resources/spotlight-av17">Projections from the Governors Highway Safety Association</a> (GHSA) predict anywhere from 20 - 40% of vehicles manufactured by 2040 will be autonomous.</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/Bicycles_AVs/TIMELINE-TO-FULL-CAR-AUTOMATION.png" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Already, the technology that enables AVs has grown exponentially in the last decade, to the point where we currently see functioning Level 4 vehicles on roadways worldwide (albeit on a trial level as most are still under supervision, and prone to adjustments as the systems run into novel situations). And progress begets progress, as they say. Given this projected eventuality, I believe it’s fair to interrogate the nature of AVs in general, as they are poised to be the next greatest technological advancement since the bread slicer gave us sliced bread.</p>

<p>Despite their potential, however, AV technology is developing faster than the policies to regulate them. Without firm regulatory guidelines, not all of the AVs, or even Level 3 AVs, on the market today are put through the same safety procedures with the same testing rigor and level of algorithmic standards; both Tesla and Uber have infamously mis-advertised or cut corners on their products, leading to unnecessary casualties - the only silver lining with these events however, is that they hopefully provided an impetus for policy and regulation. Furthermore, outside of the issue of safety, are the long-term, big picture questions. Do we really need AVs at all? Will they holistically improve our current system? Or should we be focusing our energies instead on more alternative sustainable transportations (like biking!)? As AV interest intensifies, will it divert time, attention, and funding away from multi-modal transportation, which may be better in the long term- for our physical and mental health with more exercise, our environmental health with less pollution, and our societal health with more town center city planning that focuses less on traffic diversion and highway management, and more on communal spaces? Or perhaps we do need AVs, but only in limited locations with limited fleets. Essentially, before we start regulating, we need to ask ourselves, what kind of society do we want to be?</p>

<p>This series isn’t designed to answer any of the above questions, but I believe they are important to ask. Regardless of our intentionality, our transportation preferences affect how our society is shaped and our we interact as people. I believe bicycling to be the most future forward mode of transportation, given projections of population growth and climate change, thus, how AV technology accommodates bicyclists is an important factor in adjusting for this new technology. With all this in mind, I’ll evaluate the ways in which AVs interact with bicyclists and the technology advancements that include cyclist awareness.</p>

<p><strong>Autonomous Vehicle events</strong></p>

<p>While not necessary for this article, it’s also interesting to see how far autonomous vehicle technology has come, and more than that, how quickly. I’m sure visions of self-driving vehicles existed previous to these milestones, but officially, as a population, we have been imagining an automated world for almost one hundred years.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/img/Bicycles_AVs/AVs timeline.jpg" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure">This image outlines important milestones in automation history, however, it misses a few key pitstops. 1.) In 1939, Norman Bel Geddes created the <a href="https://www.sensesatlas.com/territory/architecture/futurama-the-prototype-of-the-american-highway-city/">Futurama exhibit</a> in New York’s 1939 World’s Fair, sponsored by General Motors, and featuring an automated highway. The exhibit imagined the world 20 years in the future and was the largest scale model in history. 2.) More importantly to current technological advancements, in 1986, German engineer <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/delf-driving-car-born-1986-ernst-dickmanns-mercedes/">Ernst Dickmann</a> outfitted a Mercedes-Benz van with autonomous technology and drove it around his university campus. He then began a partnership with German car manufacturer Daimler; Dickmann’s vision is just recently coming to fruition as social experimentation and technology are converging. 3.) This image mentions the creation of the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/public/prizes">DARPA Grand Challenge</a> in 2004, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a branch of the US Department of Defense. What this image does not mention, however, is that the first two challenges were long distance races located in the Mojave Desert with a 1 and then 2-million-dollar prize. The third challenge, in 2007, was an Urban course, located at an Air Force Base in California. Prizes were again $2 million dollars. DARPA has since continued with cyber, space launch, and subterranean challenges. 4.) In 2015, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/03/delphi-thrilled-with-results-from-autonomous-cars-cross-country/">Delphi Automotive</a> driverless car becomes the first AV to complete a transcontinental trip from San Francisco to NYC. It completed it in 9 days. 5.) And in 2016, Singapore introduced its first autonomous taxi service, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/nutonomy-to-launch-worlds-first-fully-autonomous-taxi-service-in-singapore-this-year">MIT’s nuTonomy</a>, to its streets.</figcaption></figure>
