    <article>
      <p>Hi there. <em>Thanks for visiting my blog!</em></p>

<p><strong>ABOUT BLAIRE</strong></p>

<p>I am a graduate of the University of California Santa Cruz (go slugs!) where I earned my B.S. in Cognitive Science. Here, I worked as an Instructional Assistant, teaching the foundations of psychology to a class of undergraduate students. I also worked as a Research Assistant, where I learned how to credibly and efficiently conduct research, as well as how to parlay complicated information into a digestible format. While in school, I waitressed at a local restaurant, a job that offered me invaluable skills, especially when it came to working with people and task management (perhaps a controversial opinion: everyone should work in food service from the moment it’s not unethical to hire them - food service does wonders for one’s self-esteem, sense of humility, work ethic, and people skills.)</p>

<p>Currently, I work as an editor for a CA Air Pollution District, proofreading technical documents and ensuring they are understandable for the public. I’m proficient in a variety of formatting styles as well as GIS mapping and data analysis.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS THIS BLOG?</strong></p>

<p>Hogwash (a loose pun on Hobbs + Blog) generally means nonsense, and in a way that’s what this blog is. Roughly every few weeks, I will submit a series on a topic of interest. Lately, I’ve been exploring artificial intelligence, specifically it’s origins and applications. At the moment, I’m in the process of finishing a series on how the brain provided a framework for the original machine learning models. I’m also in the process of making my next series, on autonomous vehicles and bicycle interactions, and sprucing up a backlog of writing I’ve developed over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Generally, each series will have an interdisciplinary bend, which I’ll follow up with academic sources if I can find them or journal articles if the information seems credible and well-cited. At the very least, this blog will serve as a time capsule for every rabbit hole I descend, but more than that, I hope these articles may educate others who wish to take the time.</p>

<p>You can find my email at the bottom. Feel free to message me with questions or comments! Or if you notice any false or misstated information, I’m happy to review that as well. These articles are written from a single perspective (my own), but in the interest of general education, it benefits all involved to entertain more than one opinion.</p>
