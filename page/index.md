With the Biden administration underway, legislators have recently made a renewed efforts to officially pass a bill to federally regulate autonomous vehicles (AVs). While AVs are generally lauded for their innovation and potential to revolutionize not only transportation, but also society at large (a belief I too am apt to support), I think itâ€™s worth scrutinizing the safety and necessity of such vehicles. 
Are they safer than conventional vehicles with a human driver? And are they really what we need as a society? What controversies exist from current research (and lack thereof)? 
I believe that bicycle and AV interactions are an excellent case study of this dilemma.
